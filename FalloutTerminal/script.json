Just select the terminal's token and click the\rtoken macro to activate the terminal.\r\r## Terminal JSON specification\r\rThe JSON for defining a terminal's content has the following structure:\r\r```\r{\r  \"name\": String, // The name of the terminal.\r  \"content\": String, // The content of the terminal's first screen.\r  \"locked\": [Boolean], // Whether the terminal is locked. Default false.\r  \"password\": [String], // The password for the locked terminal.\r  \"attempts\": [Number], // The number of attempts allowed to guess the locked terminal's password.\r  \"screens\": [{ // The screens or screen IDs that the initial screen can access.\r    {\r      \"name\": String, // The name of this screen.\r      \"content\": [String], // The content of this screen.\r      \"screens\": [more screens] // Additional screens that can be accessed from this screen.\r    }\r  }]\r}\r```\r\r### Terminal JSON Example\r\r```\r{\r  \"name\": \"Overseer's terminal\",\r  \"locked\": false,\r  \"content\": \"Welcome to ROBCO Industries (TM) Termlink\nClearance: Overseer Eyes Only\",\r  \"screens\": [\r    {\r      \"name\": \"VAULT 111 OVERSEER INSTRUCTIONS\",\r      \"content\": \"CONFIDENTIAL CONFIDENTIAL CONFIDENTIAL\nOVERSEER EYES ONLY | VIOLATION VTP-01011\n\nVault 111 is designed to test the long-term effects of suspended animation on unaware, human subjects.
